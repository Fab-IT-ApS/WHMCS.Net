# WHMCS.Net

The idea behind WHMCS.Net is to provide, an easy to use and understand, interface for the WHMCS API.
It turns the JSON returned by the API into readable and useable classes, in DotNet.

## How to:

*if you check out Program.cs within WHMCS.Example, theres a quick guide on how to use it.*

**Alternativly you can follow on here:**
The simple version:

```C#
	string username = "UsernameOfMyWHMCSAPIUser";
	string password = "PasswordOfMyWHMCSAPIUser";
	string domain = "WHMCS.MyDomain.com";
	bool secure = true // True = Https, false = Http

    IApiService apiService = new ApiService(username, password, domain, secure);
    IJSONService jsonService = new JSONService();
    IApiDataBroker apiDataBroker = new ApiDataBroker(apiService, jsonService);

    WhmcsApi whmcsApi = new WhmcsApi(apiDataBroker);
    ProductsResponse whmcsApi.GetProducts();
```

The domain, According to the API documentation, needs to point to something like: https://WHMCS.MyDomain.com/includes/api.php
However the Https:// vs Http:// is set with the secure variable. True = Https://, false = Http://
The /includes/api.php is automatically suffixed in code.

Initializing of the wrapper, will be made easiere in the future. For now, the above is how it's done.
